#Front-end Development milestone project
The requirement for this project was to create a website for a gym website where gym members or potential clients can learn more about the gym and the facilities it has. 

**UX**
This website is mainly desgined for potential members and and provide them with an insight into Viper gym's way of training and how it differs from other gyms. 
But mainly to encourge potential members not just to join but to actively particapte in classes, use all the facililites and follow the three step plan to get "match fit".

As a first time user and potential member I want to be able to learn more information about Viper Gym, look at the facilities, gallery and timetable to see what classes
I would be interested in and sign up.

The website was designed to be simple but eye-catching to attract new members. All the sections include the same layout throughout the site for familiarity and just the right amount
of information so the user can get an idea of how Viper gym operates, without the page appearing too busy. The site was also designed to look as good on desktop as on mobile keeping
that same simplisitc theme throughout the user experience.

A pdf of the wireframe is included for reference;

**Home**

The landing page for the website mainly used to draw in the user and introduce them to the three step plan of Viper Gyym. As well as the location and how to get in contact or visit
the gym's social media sites.

The user can sign in or sign up directly from the home page below the jumbotron text.

This page gives the user a breif overview of the four main facilities; the gym, sports dome, recovery center and trainers.
